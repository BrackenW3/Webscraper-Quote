The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.
An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.
The greater our knowledge increases the more our ignorance unfolds.
"Knowledge will give you power, but character respect."
"For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone."
The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.
"A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots."
"Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity."
The goal of education is the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of truth.
I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.
The only source of knowledge is experience.
"Never stop fighting until you arrive at your destined place - that is, the unique you. Have an aim in life, continuously acquire knowledge, work hard, and have perseverance to realise the great life."
Ignorance is the curse of God; knowledge is the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.
"Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens."
A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education.
"We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid."
It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
The great aim of education is not knowledge but action.
"Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family."
Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance.
The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.
"The goal of education is not to increase the amount of knowledge but to create the possibilities for a child to invent and discover, to create men who are capable of doing new things."
True friendship can afford true knowledge. It does not depend on darkness and ignorance.
The art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge.
Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.
Beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance.
"A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way."
"Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It's about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others' success, and then standing back and letting them shine."
I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.
"If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader."
"Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It's about impact, influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire team-mates and customers."
No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit for doing it.
"No matter how good you think you are as a leader, my goodness, the people around you will have all kinds of ideas for how you can get better. So for me, the most fundamental thing about leadership is to have the humility to continue to get feedback and to try to get better - because your job is to try to help everybody else get better."
A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.
"You have to think anyway, so why not think big?"
The quality of a leader is reflected in the standards they set for themselves.
"A good leader takes a little more than his share of the blame, a little less than his share of the credit."
Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people.
"The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office."
Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success.
The task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been.
Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.
The art of communication is the language of leadership.
Honor bespeaks worth. Confidence begets trust. Service brings satisfaction. Cooperation proves the quality of leadership.
Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.
"People ask the difference between a leader and a boss. The leader leads, and the boss drives."
Leadership is a privilege to better the lives of others. It is not an opportunity to satisfy personal greed.
"You don't lead by hitting people over the head - that's assault, not leadership."
Only the guy who isn't rowing has time to rock the boat.
"My attitude is never to be satisfied, never enough, never."
"When you can't make them see the light, make them feel the heat."
"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do."
"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored."
"Success is the result of perfection, hard work, learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence."
"Stay positive and happy. Work hard and don't give up hope. Be open to criticism and keep learning. Surround yourself with happy, warm and genuine people."
"A good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination, and instill a love of learning."
"There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.
Change is the end result of all true learning.
"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."
"Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow."
"I'm learning a lot about myself being alone, and doing what I'm doing."
I learned the value of hard work by working hard.
"I'm most proud of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me, in my life. He's given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down, but you can still get back up. Hopefully I'll learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing I do."
"There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning."
Your mind will answer most questions if you learn to relax and wait for the answer.
A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.
Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.
"Growing up in a group home, and with an undiagnosed learning disability to boot, the odds of success were not on my side. But when I joined the high school football team, I learned the value of discipline, focus, persistence, and teamwork - all skills that have proven vital to my career as a C.E.O. and social entrepreneur."
"I made decisions that I regret, and I took them as learning experiences... I'm human, not perfect, like anybody else."
We learned about honesty and integrity - that the truth matters... that you don't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules... and success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square.
I am always ready to learn although I do not always like being taught.
"Patience is a virtue, and I'm learning patience. It's a tough lesson."
"The ultimate lesson all of us have to learn is unconditional love, which includes not only others but ourselves as well."
Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching.
Justice consists in doing no injury to men; decency in giving them no offense.
"If we desire respect for the law, we must first make the law respectable."
The best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly.
It is right to give every man his due.
Laws made by common consent must not be trampled on by individuals.
"People crushed by laws, have no hope but to evade power. If the laws are their enemies, they will be enemies to the law; and those who have most to hope and nothing to lose will always be dangerous."
"Justice is itself the great standing policy of civil society; and any eminent departure from it, under any circumstances, lies under the suspicion of being no policy at all."
Lawyers are the only persons in whom ignorance of the law is not punished.
"More law, less justice."
People do not win people fights. Lawyers do.
I'm trusting in the Lord and a good lawyer.
Obedience to lawful authority is the foundation of manly character.
"From your confessor, lawyer and physician, hide not your case on no condition."
The only people who benefit from lawsuits are lawyers. I think we made a couple of them rich.
"Well, when I think of steroids I think of an image. You have the advantage over someone, which is a form of cheating. I guess it wouldn't be right unless it was legal for everybody. Reason it's not legal for everybody is because it can hurt people seriously."
We owe the Aboriginal peoples a debt that is four centuries old. It is their turn to become full partners in developing an even greater Canada. And the reconciliation required may be less a matter of legal texts than of attitudes of the heart.
"I wish the government and the Minister of Justice would address these legal and constitutional arguments, but they refuse to. They want Canadians to go blindly into their brave new world, but it is not wise for a society to move blindly in any direction."
I've always thought legal addictions are a great way to create a business. Starbucks is a wonderful example.
"Alcohol, tobacco, and pharmaceutical drugs are legal, but they can hurt a lot of people."
"I busted a mirror and got seven years bad luck, but my lawyer thinks he can get me five."
"If you must break the law, do it to seize power: in all other cases observe it."
You can't just lecture the poor that they shouldn't riot or go to extremes. You have to make the means of legal redress available.
No oppression is so heavy or lasting as that which is inflicted by the perversion and exorbitance of legal authority.
I'm not sure I can say there is a clean line between me as an individual and me as a lawyer.
"I say the law should be blind to race, gender and sexual orientation, just as it claims to be blind to wealth and power. There should be no specially protected groups of any kind, except for children, the severely disabled and the elderly, whose physical frailty demands society's care."
"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once."
"There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved."
Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.
"We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us."
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
"Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth."
"The greatest gift of life is friendship, and I have received it."
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.
Smile in the mirror. Do that every morning and you'll start to see a big difference in your life.
Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.
"Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it."
"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment."
"Live life to the fullest, and focus on the positive."
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.
"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."
"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored."
You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind.
Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.
The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.
"My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style."
Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.
"Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."
"To succeed in life, you need three things: a wishbone, a backbone and a funny bone."
There are two great days in a person's life - the day we are born and the day we discover why.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
"There's a long life ahead of you and it's going to be beautiful, as long as you keep loving and hugging each other."
All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt.
"There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved."
If you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love.
Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.
Love yourself. It is important to stay positive because beauty comes from the inside out.
They invented hugs to let people know you love them without saying anything.
"Where there is great love, there are always wishes."
Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.
"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."
"Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth."
Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own.
Love will find a way through paths where wolves fear to prey.
When you love someone all your saved up wishes start coming out.
We are most alive when we're in love.
"Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness."
"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do."
"A friendship that like love is warm; A love like friendship, steady."
Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination.
"Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love."
"I know of only one duty, and that is to love."
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.
"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."
"If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they're yours; if they don't they never were."
The greatest healing therapy is friendship and love.
"Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses."
The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.
"Happy is the man who finds a true friend, and far happier is he who finds that true friend in his wife."
"A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person."
A good marriage would be between a blind wife and a deaf husband.
"When a man opens a car door for his wife, it's either a new car or a new wife."
"There is no more lovely, friendly and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage."
"Let the wife make the husband glad to come home, and let him make her sorry to see him leave."
My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me.
A good husband makes a good wife.
The secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know they're right if you love to be with them all the time.
"The real act of marriage takes place in the heart, not in the ballroom or church or synagogue. It's a choice you make - not just on your wedding day, but over and over again - and that choice is reflected in the way you treat your husband or wife."
"It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."
One should believe in marriage as in the immortality of the soul.
"May this marriage be full of laughter, our every day in paradise."
May these vows and this marriage be blessed.
"Chains do not hold a marriage together. It is threads, hundreds of tiny threads, which sew people together through the years."
"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage. But when you start playing around with constitutions, just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person, it just seems to me that's not what America's about. Usually, our constitutions expand liberties, they don't contract them."
"The first time you marry for love, the second for money, and the third for companionship."
"By all means, marry. If you get a good wife, you'll become happy; if you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher."
"Experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love. For a lasting union, they insist, there must be a genuine liking for each other. Which, in my book, is a good definition for friendship."
"Marriage is an alliance entered into by a man who can't sleep with the window shut, and a woman who can't sleep with the window open."
I think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.
"Marriage is the most natural state of man, and... the state in which you will find solid happiness."
"Ultimately, I believe the only secret to a happy marriage is choosing the right person. Life is a series of choices, right?"
A wedding is a funeral where you smell your own flowers.
"I have learned that only two things are necessary to keep one's wife happy. First, let her think she's having her own way. And second, let her have it."
"If there is such a thing as a good marriage, it is because it resembles friendship rather than love."
"We should be concerned not only about the health of individual patients, but also the health of our entire society."
The best doctor is the one you run to and can't find.
Abortion is inherently different from other medical procedures because no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.
"A Harvard Medical School study has determined that rectal thermometers are still the best way to tell a baby's temperature. Plus, it really teaches the baby who's boss."
"Wellness is not a 'medical fix' but a way of living - a lifestyle sensitive and responsive to all the dimensions of body, mind, and spirit, an approach to life we each design to achieve our highest potential for well-being now and forever."
The human body experiences a powerful gravitational pull in the direction of hope. That is why the patient's hopes are the physician's secret weapon. They are the hidden ingredients in any prescription.
The greatest evil is physical pain.
"I keep dreaming of a future, a future with a long and healthy life, not lived in the shadow of cancer but in the light."
You know what they call the fellow who finishes last in his medical school graduating class? They call him 'Doctor.'
"The physicians of one class feel the patients and go away, merely prescribing medicine. As they leave the room they simply ask the patient to take the medicine. They are the poorest class of physicians."
"The Christian's Bible is a drug store. Its contents remain the same, but the medical practice changes."
"Completeness? Happiness? These words don't come close to describing my emotions. There truly is nothing I can say to capture what motherhood means to me, particularly given my medical history."
"For many people, managing pain involves using prescription medicine in combination with complementary techniques like physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga and massage. I appreciate this because I truly believe medical care should address the person as a whole - their mind, body, and spirit."
"Patients who are being kept alive by technology and want to end their lives already have a recognized constitutional right to stop any and all medical interventions, from respirators to antibiotics. They do not need physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia."
The sacrifices made by veterans and their willingness to fight in defense of our nation merit our deep respect and praise - and to the best in benefits and medical care.
"In the 20th century, we had a century where at the beginning of the century, most of the world was agricultural and industry was very primitive. At the end of that century, we had men in orbit, we had been to the moon, we had people with cell phones and colour televisions and the Internet and amazing medical technology of all kinds."
"I have been recently diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome, an autoimmune disease which is an ongoing medical condition that affects my energy level and causes fatigue and joint pain."
"When I was a young girl, I was so crazy about animals that I wanted to do something associated with them, and I thought of being a vet. But then again, I figured I had to go to medical school, and science wasn't a good subject for me, so I dropped the idea pretty soon and thought maybe I could be a vet's assistant."
I set up a laboratory in the Department of Physiology in the Medical School in South Africa and begin to try to find a bacteriophage system which we might use to solve the genetic code.
"You may not be able to read a doctor's handwriting and prescription, but you'll notice his bills are neatly typewritten."
I am dying from the treatment of too many physicians.
"The fact that he didn't get credit for a while is more the story of social injustice. But his own spirit wasn't driven by that, and wasn't dependent upon that. He just wished he had the cash to go to medical school."
"I can say, 'Well, I'm a male. I'm a male human. I'm a medical doctor. I'm an author...' If I go to a religious point of view, I will say, 'I am a soul. I am a spirit.' If I go into science, I will say, 'I am energy. I am light.' But the truth is I have no idea what I am."
All sorts of computer errors are now turning up. You'd be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men.
They certainly give very strange names to diseases.
Medical school education and post graduate education emphasize thoroughness.
"In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."
"My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."
Guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism.
"Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it."
"I love America more than any other country in this world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually."
There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured with what is right in America.
"On what rests the hope of the republic? One country, one language, one flag!"
"Patriotism consists not in waving the flag, but in striving that our country shall be righteous as well as strong."
The willingness of America's veterans to sacrifice for our country has earned them our lasting gratitude.
Memorial Day this year is especially important as we are reminded almost daily of the great sacrifices that the men and women of the Armed Services make to defend our way of life.
"Memorial Day isn't just about honoring veterans, its honoring those who lost their lives. Veterans had the fortune of coming home. For us, that's a reminder of when we come home we still have a responsibility to serve. It's a continuation of service that honors our country and those who fell defending it."
Who sows virtue reaps honor.
I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.
There are no points of the compass on the chart of true patriotism.
America is hope. It is compassion. It is excellence. It is valor.
I have long believed that sacrifice is the pinnacle of patriotism.
I would rather be remembered by a song than by a victory.
"As America celebrates Memorial Day, we pay tribute to those who have given their lives in our nation's wars."
"The heroes of Flight 93 won the first battle in the War on Terror, and they should never be forgotten."
"Man is a military animal, glories in gunpowder, and loves parade."
The average American is nothing if not patriotic.
"A man's country is not a certain area of land, of mountains, rivers, and woods, but it is a principle and patriotism is loyalty to that principle."
"On Memorial Day, I don't want to only remember the combatants. There were also those who came out of the trenches as writers and poets, who started preaching peace, men and women who have made this world a kinder place to live."
"137 years later, Memorial Day remains one of America's most cherished patriotic observances. The spirit of this day has not changed - it remains a day to honor those who died defending our freedom and democracy."
True patriotism isn't cheap. It's about taking on a fair share of the burden of keeping America going.
There's intense national feeling in America that could be called patriotism.
"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."
It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.
Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.
"The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough."
"Wisdom, compassion, and courage are the three universally recognized moral qualities of men."
"Today is Valentine's Day - or, as men like to call it, Extortion Day!"
Reputation is what men and women think of us; character is what God and angels know of us.
Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after.
No struggle can ever succeed without women participating side by side with men.
"Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life."
"There's three things men always talk about - women, sports, and cars."
Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect.
"Sometimes negative news does come out, but it is often exaggerated and manipulated to spread scandal. Journalists sometimes risk becoming ill from coprophilia and thus fomenting coprophagia: which is a sin that taints all men and women, that is, the tendency to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects."
A gentleman is simply a patient wolf.
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
The highest prize in a world of men is the most beautiful woman available on your arm and living there in her heart loyal to you.
"Finally, let us understand that when we stand together, we will always win. When men and women stand together for justice, we win. When black, white and Hispanic people stand together for justice, we win."
"All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible."
"All successful people men and women are big dreamers. They imagine what their future could be, ideal in every respect, and then they work every day toward their distant vision, that goal or purpose."
"The goal of education is not to increase the amount of knowledge but to create the possibilities for a child to invent and discover, to create men who are capable of doing new things."
It was pride that changed angels into devils; it is humility that makes men as angels.
Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land.
"Here's the thing, men have to also mature in how they see women, too. Because they need to understand that it's not just about how we look, it's about who we are. And I am going to tell you like this, 'If you can't love me with short hair, and you telling me I got to have long hair to be loved, guess what, I ain't the one for you.'"
Men have become the tools of their tools.
What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. It has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy. It has eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like.
"My mother had a great deal of trouble with me, but I think she enjoyed it."
"One of the greatest titles in the world is parent, and one of the biggest blessings in the world is to have parents to call mom and dad."
The heart of a mother is a deep abyss at the bottom of which you will always find forgiveness.
My mother's wonderful. To me she's perfection.
"That strong mother doesn't tell her cub, Son, stay weak so the wolves can get you. She says, Toughen up, this is reality we are living in."
"I look at my father. He is one of my heroes. He is such an incredible, classy man. He was such a great father and such a great husband in so many ways, and we lived through some pretty tough times losing my mom. When I see all that he did, I think, 'Wow, that's a really wonderful man.'"
"The best part of being a mom to me is the unconditional love. I have never felt a love as pure, a love that's as rewarding."
"A father may turn his back on his child, brothers and sisters may become inveterate enemies, husbands may desert their wives, wives their husbands. But a mother's love endures through all."
My mom always said that there would be haters. Not everyone can love ya.
"You don't realize how hard it is to live on your own. But there's no mom to do your laundry, and make you dinner and to do things for you, and you don't think about little things like buying paper towels and salt."
"My mom and I have always been there for each other. We had some tough times, but she was always there for me."
"Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mom or my dad. I would never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when I sit down to write a lyric, it is in the heat of the moment, and something has just happened."
"I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker, put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table. But she taught me as I walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start, but where you're going. That's family values."
"My mom didn't let me play video games growing up, so now I do. Gaming gives me a chance to just let go, blow somebody up and fight somebody from another dimension. It's all escapism."
"I'm married to a white man, and then my daughter came out looking like the whitest white child with blonde hair and blue eyes. And I'm like, 'Omigosh, now what am I going to do?' She has my mom's features and is lighter than my husband. And my boy is browner than I am. Brown eyes and really tan."
My mom is definitely my rock.
"Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don't tell their real parents about that - you don't want to tell Mom and Dad. Kids lead a very private life. And I was a typical child, I think. I was a liar."
"My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be, and much less about what we would do."
"Once you're a mom, always a mom. It's like riding a bike, you never forget."
"Having children is my greatest achievement. It was my saviour. It switched my focus from the outside to the inside. My children are gifts, they remind me of what's important."
"The biggest surprise, which is also the best, is that I didn't know I would love motherhood as much as I do."
"It's the moms of this nation - single, married, widowed - who really hold this country together. We're the mothers, we're the wives, we're the grandmothers, we're the big sisters, we're the little sisters, we're the daughters. You know it's true, don't you? You're the ones who always have to do a little more."
"My mom raised me to be clean, so it's in my nature. I have two little girls, and I'm married, but we've got a nanny and a maid."
"I ask people why they have deer heads on their walls. They always say because it's such a beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother is attractive, but I have photographs of her."
Only mothers can think of the future - because they give birth to it in their children.
Motherhood has a very humanizing effect. Everything gets reduced to essentials.
Work like you don't need the money. Love like you've never been hurt. Dance like nobody's watching.
"The greatest legacy one can pass on to one's children and grandchildren is not money or other material things accumulated in one's life, but rather a legacy of character and faith."
Honesty is the best policy - when there is money in it.
"Money can buy you a fine dog, but only love can make him wag his tail."
"Success comes to those who dedicate everything to their passion in life. To be successful, it is also very important to be humble and never let fame or money travel to your head."
"Money is not the only answer, but it makes a difference."
I'd like to live as a poor man with lots of money.
A rich man is nothing but a poor man with money.
Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.
Friends and good manners will carry you where money won't go.
Rule No.1: Never lose money. Rule No.2: Never forget rule No.1.
A little thought and a little kindness are often worth more than a great deal of money.
Never spend your money before you have earned it.
"This is a wonderful planet, and it is being completely destroyed by people who have too much money and power and no empathy."
"Money won't create success, the freedom to make it will."
Whoever said money can't buy happiness simply didn't know where to go shopping.
Success isn't measured by money or power or social rank. Success is measured by your discipline and inner peace.
"The first time you marry for love, the second for money, and the third for companionship."
A fool and his money are soon elected.
Private jets cost a lot of money.
"My parents survived the Great Depression and brought me up to live within my means, save some for tomorrow, share and don't be greedy, work hard for the necessities in life knowing that money does not make you better or more important than anyone else. So, extravagance has been bred out of my DNA."
"To get rich, you have to be making money while you're asleep."
"To give real service you must add something which cannot be bought or measured with money, and that is sincerity and integrity."
No one's ever achieved financial fitness with a January resolution that's abandoned by February.
A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man.
Recession is when a neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you lose yours.
Smile in the mirror. Do that every morning and you'll start to see a big difference in your life.
"Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it."
"I may be drunk, Miss, but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly."
There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope.
"If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late."
"When you rise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life, for your strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies in yourself."
"Every day I feel is a blessing from God. And I consider it a new beginning. Yeah, everything is beautiful."
"Everyone has highs and lows that they have to learn from, but every morning I start off with a good head on my shoulders, saying to myself, 'It's going to be a good day!'."
Think in the morning. Act in the noon. Eat in the evening. Sleep in the night.
"In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
"When I wake up every morning, I thank God for the new day."
Nothing is more beautiful than the loveliness of the woods before sunrise.
Prayer is the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening.
"Opportunities are like sunrises. If you wait too long, you miss them."
"Some people dream of success, while other people get up every morning and make it happen."
"Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days. An old day passes, a new day arrives. The important thing is to make it meaningful: a meaningful friend - or a meaningful day."
"My children are the reason I laugh, smile and want to get up every morning."
"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."
"Every morning brings new potential, but if you dwell on the misfortunes of the day before, you tend to overlook tremendous opportunities."
"I wake up every morning literally with a smile on my face, grateful for another day I never thought I'd see."
I'm always thinking about creating. My future starts when I wake up every morning... Every day I find something creative to do with my life.
"Makeup is no different than clothes and accessories - it's embellishments for your face. And it also gives you creative freedom. You get to have that moment in front the mirror every morning and give yourself self-love. You're making yourself up beautiful, which is essentially self-love."
"On Sunday morning, I'm not nervous... I can't wait to tell what God wants me to say."
"This morning of the small snow I count the blessings, the leak in the faucet which makes of the sink time, the drop of the water on water."
True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country.
"Maxi dresses are also my best friend. They take me from my morning coffee, to the beach, to nighttime."
"All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother."
I remember my mother's prayers and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all my life.
"Mama was my greatest teacher, a teacher of compassion, love and fearlessness. If love is sweet as a flower, then my mother is that sweet flower of love."
Sometimes the strength of motherhood is greater than natural laws.
"God could not be everywhere, and therefore he made mothers."
My mom is definitely my rock.
With what price we pay for the glory of motherhood.
I was always at peace because of the way my mom treated me.
"If evolution really works, how come mothers only have two hands?"
Children are the anchors that hold a mother to life.
Motherhood is... difficult and... rewarding.
"Mother's love is peace. It need not be acquired, it need not be deserved."
Life began with waking up and loving my mother's face.
Mother is the name for God in the lips and hearts of little children.
The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.
Who's a boy gonna talk to if not his mother?
The love of a mother is the veil of a softer light between the heart and the heavenly Father.
A mother's arms are made of tenderness and children sleep soundly in them.
Motherhood: All love begins and ends there.
My mother is a walking miracle.
"My dear Mama, you are definitely the hen who hatched a famous duck."
"A mother's happiness is like a beacon, lighting up the future but reflected also on the past in the guise of fond memories."
"It may be possible to gild pure gold, but who can make his mother more beautiful?"
I got to grow up with a mother who taught me to believe in me.
When my mother had to get dinner for 8 she'd just make enough for 16 and only serve half.
"The babe at first feeds upon the mother's bosom, but it is always on her heart."
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
"Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth."
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
"Good, better, best. Never let it rest. 'Til your good is better and your better is best."
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
"If you fell down yesterday, stand up today."
"In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can."
"Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later."
"Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground."
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
"Quality is not an act, it is a habit."
Accept the challenges so that you can feel the exhilaration of victory.
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.
"If you can dream it, you can do it."
Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.
You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
"Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines."
"A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others."
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.
We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.
"I like to go out if there's a party or go to the movies, but I just like hanging out with my buddies and having a good time."
"If the boy and girl walk off into the sunset hand-in-hand in the last scene, it adds 10 million to the box office."
"Now on Friday nights, if I want to go hang out with friends, I go hang out with friends. If I want to stay in and be in the hot tub and have people over to watch movies, I do that."
"When I was a boy, I always saw myself as a hero in comic books and in movies. I grew up believing this dream."
"A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order."
I think they should have movies in restaurants. I can't believe that so many people get together just to sit there. It's so abstract... isn't it abstract? What are these people sitting here watching?
"Nothing was planned in my career. I just went with the flow and took everything that came to me. Selling potato chips was obvious, as it was a family business. When friends suggested I should try theatre, I gave it a shot. Then I did a lot of advertisements, and then movies happened."
A cinema villain essentially needs a moustache so he can twiddle with it gleefully as he cooks up his next nasty plan.
"A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later."
Movies can and do have tremendous influence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood.
I never thought I'd land in pictures with a face like mine.
"I think it would be very boring dramatically to have a film where everybody was a lawyer or doctor and had no faults. To me, the most important thing is to be truthful."
"When people ask me if I went to film school I tell them, 'no, I went to films.'"
"It'll be the Internet and piracy that will kill film. There's a philosophy that the Internet should be free, but the reality is that piracy will destroy the film industry and film as an art form because it's expensive to make a movie. Maybe you'll have funky little independent movies, and it'll go back and then start up again some other way."
I really don't like to do back-to-back movies. I concentrate on things at home. My family and school life are important to me. I try to do one movie a year.
"I don't want to imitate life in movies; I want to represent it. And in that representation, you use the colors you feel, and sometimes they are fake colors. But always it's to show one emotion."
Everything I learned I learned from the movies.
"Sexiness, particularly in movies, is the chess game in the 'Thomas Crown Affair'. It's, it's, I don't know, but Faye Dunaway comes up a lot in that thinking. It's the subtlety of sexiness. The moment you try to be sexy, then it's not."
"Oh, I love horror movies, yeah."
"I like the old, classic scary movies. I love 'Psycho,' 'The Sixth Sense,' and 'Poltergeist.'"
"Horror movies don't exist unless you go and see them, and people always will."
"I have very vivid dreams - almost always action-adventure. I'm often on the run. I've always had dreams. When I was little, I'd go to sleep with my head on my hands, which were in fists like I was looking through a camera. I felt like sleep was the movies - just drifting off to the movies."
"I never was that boy who loved gangster films, but when I was growing up, I was obsessed with the detective Dick Tracy. It was one of my favourite movies as a kid, and he really inspired me. I would have loved to be part of that golden age of Hollywood in the 1940s. It made me want to become an actor."
"Music is still part of my life, but I hate the idea of people coming to see me play the guitar because they've seen me in movies. You want people who are listening to be only interested in the music."
"Look, at the same time that I don't want to be a celebrity, I understand that when you make movies you put yourself out in the public eye. I'd be a baby and a fool to be like, 'Why are there cameras taking pictures of me?' when I'm on a billboard for a movie. I think that's a very absurd concept."
"The difference between life and the movies is that a script has to make sense, and life doesn't."
The greatest healing therapy is friendship and love.
"Every day is a new day, and you'll never be able to find happiness if you don't move on."
"Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness, immobilized by the gravity of my loss, or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have - life itself."
"To help yourself, you must be yourself. Be the best that you can be. When you make a mistake, learn from it, pick yourself up and move on."
I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.
"You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space."
"It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure."
Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken.
"Forgiving does not erase the bitter past. A healed memory is not a deleted memory. Instead, forgiving what we cannot forget creates a new way to remember. We change the memory of our past into a hope for our future."
Forget the past.
"If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. And if they don't, they never were."
"Don't dwell on what went wrong. Instead, focus on what to do next. Spend your energies on moving forward toward finding the answer."
"Moving on, is a simple thing, what it leaves behind is hard."
Don't brood. Get on with living and loving. You don't have forever.
"It is only through labor and painful effort, by grim energy and resolute courage, that we move on to better things."
"I tell you the past is a bucket of ashes, so live not in your yesterdays, no just for tomorrow, but in the here and now. Keep moving and forget the post mortems; and remember, no one can get the jump on the future."
The words of kindness are more healing to a drooping heart than balm or honey.
I think you have to pay for love with bitter tears.
"You may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing that we call 'failure' is not the falling down, but the staying down."
"Healing takes courage, and we all have courage, even if we have to dig a little to find it."
"Love one another and help others to rise to the higher levels, simply by pouring out love. Love is infectious and the greatest healing energy."
"The willow which bends to the tempest, often escapes better than the oak which resists it; and so in great calamities, it sometimes happens that light and frivolous spirits recover their elasticity and presence of mind sooner than those of a loftier character."
A man never knows how to say goodbye; a woman never knows when to say it.
"Do not measure your loss by itself; if you do, it will seem intolerable; but if you will take all human affairs into account you will find that some comfort is to be derived from them."
"One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain."
"There is pleasure in the pathless woods, there is rapture in the lonely shore, there is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar; I love not Man the less, but Nature more."
Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent.
"Next to the Word of God, the noble art of music is the greatest treasure in the world."
"Where words fail, music speaks."
"Music is love, love is music, music is life, and I love my life. Thank you and good night."
"If music be the food of love, play on."
There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.
"Feelings aroused by the touch of someone's hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith - all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well."
"Without music, life would be a mistake."
"Of all the music that reached farthest into heaven, it is the beating of a loving heart."
Love is a friendship set to music.
"Music should strike fire from the heart of man, and bring tears from the eyes of woman."
"I'm not a pretty princess, and I'm aware of that, so I like music that is really intense, really bold, and characters that in a way almost have a dark side and are kind of evil because, for me, that's when I feel my strongest and fiercest, when I'm not necessarily the good girl."
Music is the movement of sound to reach the soul for the education of its virtue.
Music is a safe kind of high.
"Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything."
Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.
"The dance can reveal everything mysterious that is hidden in music, and it has the additional merit of being human and palpable. Dancing is poetry with arms and legs."
If you don't know the blues... there's no point in picking up the guitar and playing rock and roll or any other form of popular music.
Mathematics is the music of reason.
The best thing about being a DJ is making people happy. There is nothing like seeing people get up from a table to dance or the expression on their face when they hear a song they love. I also love to educate people on music they have never heard.
"Every man's work, whether it be literature, or music or pictures or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself."
That's the amazing thing about music: there's a song for every emotion. Can you imagine a world with no music? It would suck.
"The world is full of poetry. The air is living with its spirit; and the waves dance to the music of its melodies, and sparkle in its brightness."
I think the path is different for everybody. Go after the doors that are open to you. That has always been my motto getting into the music business. Do the things that seem to be good opportunities and work hard at it. Try to make good decisions and be nice. Hopefully all of that will pay off at some point.
Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination.
"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better."
In the depth of winter I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer.
"So many times, people told me I can't do this or can't do that. My nature is that I don't listen very well. I'm very determined, and I believe in myself. My parents brought me up that way. Thank God for that. I don't let anything stand in my way."
"Just living is not enough... one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower."
"The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep."
Joy in looking and comprehending is nature's most beautiful gift.
Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.
"There is pleasure in the pathless woods, there is rapture in the lonely shore, there is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar; I love not Man the less, but Nature more."
"Youth is the gift of nature, but age is a work of art."
In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.
"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."
"We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls."
"Words, like nature, half reveal and half conceal the soul within."
The sky broke like an egg into full sunset and the water caught fire.
"Wherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine."
"Keep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean."
Sunsets are so beautiful that they almost seem as if we were looking through the gates of Heaven.
"Another thing I like to do is sit back and take in nature. To look at the birds, listen to their singing, go hiking, camping and jogging and running, walking along the beach, playing games and sometimes being alone with the great outdoors. It's very special to me."
"Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather."
"Sunset is still my favorite color, and rainbow is second."
Colors are the smiles of nature.
The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain.
The family is one of nature's masterpieces.
Every flower is a soul blossoming in nature.
A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.
Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.
"New Year's Day. A fresh start. A new chapter in life waiting to be written. New questions to be asked, embraced, and loved. Answers to be discovered and then lived in this transformative year of delight and self-discovery. Today carve out a quiet interlude for yourself in which to dream, pen in hand. Only dreams give birth to change."
"Be at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every new year find you a better man."
And now we welcome the new year. Full of things that have never been.
"I had a New Year's kiss once. But it was like, 'Let's start the year off together,' and then we wound up breaking up the night after!"
"And suns grow meek, and the meek suns grow brief, and the year smiles as it draws near its death."
"The new year stands before us, like a chapter in a book, waiting to be written. We can help write that story by setting goals."
I doubt if you can have a truly wild party without liquor.
"New Year's Resolution: To tolerate fools more gladly, provided this does not encourage them to take up more of my time."
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right.
"I have no way of knowing how people really feel, but the vast majority of those I meet couldn't be nicer. Every once in a while someone barks at me. My New Year's resolution is not to bark back."
"Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering, 'It will be happier.'"
"I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something."
Take a leap of faith and begin this wondrous new year by believing. Believe in yourself. And believe that there is a loving Source - a Sower of Dreams - just waiting to be asked to help you make your dreams come true.
I never worry about being driven to drink; I just worry about being driven home.
"To be an ideal guest, stay at home."
"To have the kind of year you want to have, something has to happen that you can't explain why it happened. Something has to happen that you can't coach."
What I like to drink most is wine that belongs to others.
"Make New Year's goals. Dig within, and discover what you would like to have happen in your life this year. This helps you do your part. It is an affirmation that you're interested in fully living life in the year to come."
"Going to a party, for me, is as much a learning experience as, you know, sitting in a lecture."
Dick Clark will be truly missed. We will carry on his legacy every New Year's Eve.
"Your success and happiness lies in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties."
"Those who gave thee a body, furnished it with weakness; but He who gave thee Soul, armed thee with resolution. Employ it, and thou art wise; be wise and thou art happy."
I've had some lovely extraordinary experiences on New Year's Eve.
I don't even drink! I can't stand the taste of alcohol. Every New Year's Eve I try one drink and every time it makes me feel sick. So I don't touch booze - I'm always the designated driver.
"Ring out the false, ring in the true."
It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children.
I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection.
A child who is allowed to be disrespectful to his parents will not have true respect for anyone.
We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves.
"To be a good father and mother requires that the parents defer many of their own needs and desires in favor of the needs of their children. As a consequence of this sacrifice, conscientious parents develop a nobility of character and learn to put into practice the selfless truths taught by the Savior Himself."
"My children are the reason I laugh, smile and want to get up every morning."
"Always kiss your children goodnight, even if they're already asleep."
"Let parents bequeath to their children not riches, but the spirit of reverence."
"To me luxury is to be at home with my daughter, and the occasional massage doesn't hurt."
Having a baby is a life-changer. It gives you a whole other perspective on why you wake up every day.
"At the end of the day, the most overwhelming key to a child's success is the positive involvement of parents."
Children are educated by what the grown-up is and not by his talk.
"My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be, and much less about what we would do."
"Believe me, my children have more stamina than a power station."
"If you bungle raising your children, I don't think whatever else you do matters very much."
"Education, like neurosis, begins at home."
"Happiness is not always through success. Equally, the constant pursuit of success is sure unhappiness. But we have to find the balance. My own thoughts are that parenting is very personal. And we all feel enormous insecurity about parenting. What are they going to think of us 20 years down the line?"
"Parenting is the hardest thing I have ever done. I tried to find the balance between the strict, traditional Chinese way I was raised, which I think can be too harsh, and what I see as a tendency in the West to be too permissive and indulgent. If I could do it all again, I would, with some adjustments."
"Don't judge other people. For example, if you want God's anointing to be on you for parenting, you need to be careful not to criticize other parents."
"Loving and parenting a dog as a single parent can create all sorts of new and unusual problems, but also new sources of joy."
"Screaming at children over their grades, especially to the point of the child's tears, is child abuse, pure and simple. It's not funny and it's not good parenting. It is a crushing, scarring, disastrous experience for the child. It isn't the least bit funny."
"Loving a child doesn't mean giving in to all his whims; to love him is to bring out the best in him, to teach him to love what is difficult."
I regret not having had more time with my kids when they were growing up.
"Childhood obesity is best tackled at home through improved parental involvement, increased physical exercise, better diet and restraint from eating."
"Most people who have grown up introverted in this very extroverted culture of ours have had painful experiences of feeling like they are out of step with what's expected of them. Parenting can pose unique challenges for introverted parents, who fear that their own painful experiences will be repeated in their children's lives."
"Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world."
The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.
"Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success."
Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.
"I believe that a trusting attitude and a patient attitude go hand in hand. You see, when you let go and learn to trust God, it releases joy in your life. And when you trust God, you're able to be more patient. Patience is not just about waiting for something... it's about how you wait, or your attitude while waiting."
Never cut a tree down in the wintertime. Never make a negative decision in the low time. Never make your most important decisions when you are in your worst moods. Wait. Be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come.
Great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance.
"Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet."
Be patient and understanding. Life is too short to be vengeful or malicious.
Have patience. All things are difficult before they become easy.
Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish.
"Patience is a virtue, and I'm learning patience. It's a tough lesson."
"Sometimes we may ask God for success, and He gives us physical and mental stamina. We might plead for prosperity, and we receive enlarged perspective and increased patience, or we petition for growth and are blessed with the gift of grace. He may bestow upon us conviction and confidence as we strive to achieve worthy goals."
I am patient with stupidity but not with those who are proud of it.
"We could never learn to be brave and patient, if there were only joy in the world."
"Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity."
"A wise man is superior to any insults which can be put upon him, and the best reply to unseemly behavior is patience and moderation."
"Obstacles, of course, are developmentally necessary: they teach kids strategy, patience, critical thinking, resilience and resourcefulness."
Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience.
"Endurance is nobler than strength, and patience than beauty."
"No, I will be the pattern of all patience; I will say nothing."
"The practice of patience toward one another, the overlooking of one another's defects, and the bearing of one another's burdens is the most elementary condition of all human and social activity in the family, in the professions, and in society."
Only those who have patience to do simple things perfectly ever acquire the skill to do difficult things easily.
"The more you know yourself, the more patience you have for what you see in others."
"Faith is not simply a patience that passively suffers until the storm is past. Rather, it is a spirit that bears things - with resignations, yes, but above all, with blazing, serene hope."
"There is no harm in patience, and no profit in lamentation. Death is easier to bear (than) that which precedes it, and more severe than that which comes after it. Remember the death of the Apostle of God, and your sorrow will be lessened."
My dream is of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last best hope of earth.
"We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense."
A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government.
"To survive in peace and harmony, united and strong, we must have one people, one nation, one flag."
Guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism.
"If we ever forget that we are One Nation Under God, then we will be a nation gone under."
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
"I saw courage both in the Vietnam War and in the struggle to stop it. I learned that patriotism includes protest, not just military service."
"Patriotism is love of country. But you can't love your country without loving your countrymen and countrywomen. We don't always have to agree, but we must empower each other, we must find the common ground, we must build bridges across our differences to pursue the common good."
Patriot: the person who can holler the loudest without knowing what he is hollering about.
This nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.
"America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand."
"It is lamentable, that to be a good patriot one must become the enemy of the rest of mankind."
The patriot's blood is the seed of Freedom's tree.
"It was my duty to shoot the enemy, and I don't regret it. My regrets are for the people I couldn't save: Marines, soldiers, buddies. I'm not naive, and I don't romanticize war. The worst moments of my life have come as a SEAL. But I can stand before God with a clear conscience about doing my job."
"Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it."
"Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism - how passionately I hate them!"
"Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory."
Patriotism demands of us sustained sacrifice.
Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious.
"Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!"
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.
"The patriot volunteer, fighting for country and his rights, makes the most reliable soldier on earth."
"There is a fuzzy but real distinction that can and I believe should be made, between patriotism, which is attachment to a way of life, and nationalism, which is the insistence that your way of life deserves to rule over other ways of life."
Let no American imagine that Zionism is inconsistent with patriotism. Multiple loyalties are objectionable only if they are inconsistent.
"It was patriotism, not communism, that inspired me."
"To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one's own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him."
"Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth."
I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.
Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.
Share your smile with the world. It's a symbol of friendship and peace.
Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all.
"For every minute you remain angry, you give up sixty seconds of peace of mind."
"Peace is not absence of conflict, it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means."
"Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come."
"I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness; I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too. I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and tranquility will return once more."
Peace begins with a smile.
War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.
"I speak not for myself but for those without voice... those who have fought for their rights... their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated."
Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
"So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality, nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit."
"Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal."
You'll never find peace of mind until you listen to your heart.
"Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow."
Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.
"As most of the population suffers through life, barely surviving, disappointed and confused day after day, hopeless, wondering what happened to their strong and beautiful country, it is in the media's power to restore, if not some of our quality of life, at least a bit of our peace of mind."
To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.
"A real man loves his wife, and places his family as the most important thing in life. Nothing has brought me more peace and content in life than simply being a good husband and father."
"To survive in peace and harmony, united and strong, we must have one people, one nation, one flag."
Success isn't measured by money or power or social rank. Success is measured by your discipline and inner peace.
A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself.
"Money can buy you a fine dog, but only love can make him wag his tail."
There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.
Time spent with cats is never wasted.
"Animals have a much better attitude to life and death than we do. They know when their time has come. We are the ones that suffer when they pass, but it's a healing kind of grief that enables us to deal with other griefs that are not so easy to grab hold of."
"No matter how much cats fight, there always seem to be plenty of kittens."
Until one has loved an animal a part of one's soul remains unawakened.
Pets are humanizing. They remind us we have an obligation and responsibility to preserve and nurture and care for all life.
Just watching my cats can make me happy.
"You cannot share your life with a dog, as I had done in Bournemouth, or a cat, and not know perfectly well that animals have personalities and minds and feelings."
"Women and cats will do as they please, and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea."
The clever cat eats cheese and breathes down rat holes with baited breath.
"Cats are rather delicate creatures and they are subject to a good many different ailments, but I have never heard of one who suffered from insomnia."
"The better I get to know men, the more I find myself loving dogs."
In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this.
"A few years ago, the city council of Monza, Italy, barred pet owners from keeping goldfish in curved bowls... saying that it is cruel to keep a fish in a bowl with curved sides because, gazing out, the fish would have a distorted view of reality. But how do we know we have the true, undistorted picture of reality?"
Gypsy was the name my brother gave a pet turtle he had. I always thought it was so peculiar.
There is no psychiatrist in the world like a puppy licking your face.
I wish I could write as mysterious as a cat.
My little dog - a heartbeat at my feet.
He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.
"Cats are inquisitive, but hate to admit it."
Never wear anything that panics the cat.
"Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole."
It's difficult to understand why people don't realize that pets are gifts to mankind.
"People always joke that 'dog' spells 'god' backwards. They should consider that it might be the higher power coming down to see just how well they do, what kind of people they are. The animals are right here, right in front of us. And how we treat these companions is a test."
Poetry is when an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found words.
"Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas."
"The dance can reveal everything mysterious that is hidden in music, and it has the additional merit of being human and palpable. Dancing is poetry with arms and legs."
"The world is full of poetry. The air is living with its spirit; and the waves dance to the music of its melodies, and sparkle in its brightness."
Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.
Poetry is the one place where people can speak their original human mind. It is the outlet for people to say in public what is known in private.
"A man of eighty has outlived probably three new schools of painting, two of architecture and poetry and a hundred in dress."
"The cloning of humans is on most of the lists of things to worry about from Science, along with behaviour control, genetic engineering, transplanted heads, computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic flowers."
"I'm fascinated by rap and by hip-hop. I think there's a lot of poetry in it. There's a lot of anger, a lot of social energy in it. And I think you'd better listen to it pretty carefully, 'cause it's important."
Some people go to priests; others to poetry; I to my friends.
"A poet's work is to name the unnameable, to point at frauds, to take sides, start arguments, shape the world, and stop it going to sleep."
"Poetry is an echo, asking a shadow to dance."
Any healthy man can go without food for two days - but not without poetry.
Poetry is an orphan of silence. The words never quite equal the experience behind them.
"A poem is never finished, only abandoned."
"A poet is a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds."
"A poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language."
Personality is everything in art and poetry.
Writing a book of poetry is like dropping a rose petal down the Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo.
"Poetry is the universal language which the heart holds with nature and itself. He who has a contempt for poetry, cannot have much respect for himself, or for anything else."
"Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would contain it."
"One of the things I've always liked about my husband is he's very good at lots of stuff. He was an English teacher when I met him. He wrote poetry and played the guitar. As time went on, he decided to go into economics, so he's very analytical and mathematical in addition to his artsy side."
"There is no gender to my music. There's no male or female voice, no trite lyrics or poetry. It's much more abstract, so it lives with you longer."
"I always liked the magic of poetry but now I'm just starting to see behind the curtain of even the best poets, how they've used, tried and tested craft to create the illusion. Wonderful feeling of exhilaration to finally be there."
"On the subject of literary genres, I've always felt that my response to poetry is inadequate. I'd love to be the kind of person that drifts off into the garden with a slim volume of Elizabethan verse or a sheaf of haikus, but my passion is story."
"Versatility of education can be found in our best poetry, but the depth of mankind should be found in the philosopher."
The revolution is a dictatorship of the exploited against the exploiters.
I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy.
"I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend."
"One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace, good people don't go into government."
Healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have.
Voting is a civic sacrament.
Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did.
A fool and his money are soon elected.
"We have to be bold in our national ambitions. First, we must win the fight against poverty within the next decade. Second, we must improve moral standards in government and society to provide a strong foundation for good governance. Third, we must change the character of our politics to promote fertile ground for reforms."
No science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power.
One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.
"If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all."
"I am a teacher. It's how I define myself. A good teacher isn't someone who gives the answers out to their kids but is understanding of needs and challenges and gives tools to help other people succeed. That's the way I see myself, so whatever it is that I will do eventually after politics, it'll have to do a lot with teaching."
"Whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices, a rottenness begins in his conduct."
I think the ideology of the Congress is closest to mine. Congress is a party where I should be. I have joined politics to bring change in society. The Congress gave me a chance with the Aadhaar project. It's a party that will allow me to bring change.
"Conservatives are not necessarily stupid, but most stupid people are conservatives."
"I have long enjoyed the friendship and companionship of Republicans because I am by instinct a teacher, and I would like to teach them something."
"NASA is an engine of innovation and inspiration as well as the world's premier space exploration agency, and we are well served by politicians working to keep it that way, instead of turning it into a mere jobs program, or worse, cutting its budget."
"I think one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage you to be nasty. We encourage you to be neat, obedient, loyal and faithful and all those Boy Scout words, which would be great around a campfire but are lousy in politics."
There are no morals in politics; there is only expedience. A scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel.
"As a black woman, my politics and political affiliation are bound up with and flow from participation in my people's struggle for liberation, and with the fight of oppressed people all over the world against American imperialism."
The Conservatives do not want to go into an election with the leaders' relative ratings as they are - but it is depressing to hear that plans are afoot to paint Miliband as the Michael Dukakis of British politics: part of a metropolitan elite with no understanding of mainstream concerns.
"What modern humans need help with is escaping from the despair of politics, commerce and media, escaping from the drabness and oppressiveness of worldly values and seeing through suburban mentality and normal community standards so that they can find some much-needed relief for their wilting souls."
"When dealing with American politics, you try to follow the money, and that's where it leads you. It doesn't take you to the electoral college or to Princeton. It takes you down the darker alleys of American life."
"When you get together in a group, it becomes like a family, with the different personalities and the politics that comes with being in a band. It's different than bringing something in by yourself."
"We associate the North Atlantic with cod. The motto of Newfoundland used to be 'In cod we trust.' It was a joke, but it was essentially true. But there is no cod anymore. And that's extraordinary. It's all because of either greed or politics - Canadian politics."
Love yourself. It is important to stay positive because beauty comes from the inside out.
"Live life to the fullest, and focus on the positive."
"Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results."
"A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success."
You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind.

"I believe if you keep your faith, you keep your trust, you keep the right attitude, if you're grateful, you'll see God open up new doors."
Your smile will give you a positive countenance that will make people feel comfortable around you.
"Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose."
"Stay positive and happy. Work hard and don't give up hope. Be open to criticism and keep learning. Surround yourself with happy, warm and genuine people."
Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive one.
"Work hard, stay positive, and get up early. It's the best part of the day."
"Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain."
Every day brings new choices.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
In order to carry a positive action we must develop here a positive vision.
"No matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep working towards it and you'll find the positive side of things."
"Trust in dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity."
"Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them."
God never ends anything on a negative; God always ends on a positive.
I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.
Virtually nothing is impossible in this world if you just put your mind to it and maintain a positive attitude.
"I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose. There are no accidents; we're all teachers - if we're willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn, trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks or wait for some miracle to come knocking at our door."
Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.
"Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come."
"A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results."
Beauty is power; a smile is its sword.
"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."
"Knowledge will give you power, but character respect."
"Every day we have plenty of opportunities to get angry, stressed or offended. But what you're doing when you indulge these negative emotions is giving something outside yourself power over your happiness. You can choose to not let little things upset you."
When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.
"We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies."
"Words are singularly the most powerful force available to humanity. We can choose to use this force constructively with words of encouragement, or destructively using words of despair. Words have energy and power with the ability to help, to heal, to hinder, to hurt, to harm, to humiliate and to humble."
Loyalty and devotion lead to bravery. Bravery leads to the spirit of self-sacrifice. The spirit of self-sacrifice creates trust in the power of love.
"The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses."
"Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country."

"Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around."
"Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family."
"When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful."
We were all born with a certain degree of power. The key to success is discovering this innate power and using it daily to deal with whatever challenges come our way.
"Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody's power and is not easy."
Power means happiness; power means hard work and sacrifice.
"There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love."
Truth is powerful and it prevails.
"If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind."
It is a paradox that every dictator has climbed to power on the ladder of free speech. Immediately on attaining power each dictator has suppressed all free speech except his own.

Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality.

I think one of the most important things in a relationship is caring for your significant other through good times and bad."
I'm lucky in having found the perfect partner to spend my life with.
"We are afraid to care too much, for fear that the other person does not care at all."
"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."
There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.
We don't develop courage by being happy every day. We develop it by surviving difficult times and challenging adversity.
"When a woman is talking to you, listen to what she says with her eyes."
How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours.
I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase.
The relationship between husband and wife should be one of closest friends.
"There is no more lovely, friendly and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage."

"The most important thing is to have a good relationship with the bike... you have to understand what she wants. I think of a motorcycle as a woman, and I know that sounds silly, but it's true."
People change and forget to tell each other.
"The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them."
You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.
"Any relationship should have love, and if there is no love, it is better to call off a relationship. People say that love happens only once, but I don't believe in it because for me, if one relationship doesn't work, you should move on and seek love in another relationship. Who knows; you might find love in the second relationship."
"I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies."

"Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life."
A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education.
You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.
My religion is very simple. My religion is kindness.
To be a Christian without prayer is no more possible than to be alive without breathing.
"It is my goal to love everyone. I hate no one.

"I have an everyday religion that works for me. Love yourself first, and everything else falls into line."
"God is to be worshipped as the one beloved, dearer than everything in this and next life."
"Just as the soul fills the body, so God fills the world. Just as the soul bears the body, so God endures the world. Just as the soul sees but is not seen, so God sees but is not seen. Just as the soul feeds the body, so God gives food to the world."
All religions must be tolerated... for every man must get to heaven in his own way.
"This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness."

I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.
"Instead of being presented with stereotypes by age, sex, color, class, or religion, children must have the opportunity to learn that within each range, some people are loathsome and some are delightful."
A strong argument for the religion of Christ is this - that offences against Charity are about the only ones which men on their death-beds can be made - not to understand - but to feel - as crime.
The first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion.
"In fact, I thought that Christianity was very a good and a very valuable thing for us. But after a while, I began to feel that the story that I was told about this religion wasn't perhaps completely whole, that something was left out."
"Knowledge will give you power, but character respect."
One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.
"We don't need to share the same opinions as others, but we need to be respectful."
"If we lose love and self respect for each other, this is how we finally die."
I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me... All I ask is that you respect me as a human being.

"The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life."

"Our parents deserve our honor and respect for giving us life itself. Beyond this they almost always made countless sacrifices as they cared for and nurtured us through our infancy and childhood, provided us with the necessities of life, and nursed us through physical illnesses and the emotional stresses of growing up."
"Football is like life - it requires perseverance, self-denial, hard work, sacrifice, dedication and respect for authority."
"Literature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it. It enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides; and in this respect, it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become."
"When you practice gratefulness, there is a sense of respect toward others."
"There are lots of people I admire and respect, but I don't necessarily want to be like them. I'm too happy being myself."
"I respect everybody, but at the same time, I carry myself with an aura that demands respect, too."
"People are roasting each other at parties, at work events, around the fire. It's so fun. People are busting each other's chops, and it's a sign of affection, truly. It's a true test of love and friendship: can you make a man laugh at himself? So what makes a good burn? Go after targets you love and respect. And hit 'em hard."
"The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge, place I've always gone where I needed comfort and peace. It's been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction. It's a relationship that has evolved over time, given me the greatest respect and love for the game."
"One thing I've learned through all the ups and downs is that if you're doing things right, then you have a core group of people. Not just a core group like your homies or your buddies, but a group of people that has a good influence on you, who you respect and admire, and you know that if they're on your side, you're doing something right."
"Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery."
"Without feelings of respect, what is there to distinguish men from beasts?"
"A beautiful woman delights the eye; a wise woman, the understanding; a pure one, the soul."
True love stories never have endings.
"When you look at me, when you think of me, I am in paradise."
Love is the silent saying and saying of a single name.
"If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life."
All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.
I love you the more in that I believe you had liked me for my own sake and for nothing else.
And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.
"I am in you and you in me, mutual in divine love."
I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase.
Kiss me and you will see how important I am.
"Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope."
"Love planted a rose, and the world turned sweet."
The real lover is the man who can thrill you just by touching your head or smiling into your eyes - or just by staring into space.
"A tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely fellow, always hopeful of romance and adventure."
"I love Valentine's Day! I love it, I love it, I love it. I like having doors opened for me. My favorite romantic comedy is 'When Harry Met Sally.'"
"Of all the music that reached farthest into heaven, it is the beating of a loving heart."
A man's kiss is his signature.
When I walk with you I feel as if I had a flower in my buttonhole.
"It is really rare to find someone you really, really love and that you want to spend your life with and all that stuff that goes along with being married. I am one of those lucky people. And I think she feels that way too. So the romantic stuff is easy because you want them to be happy."
I love you more than my own skin.
"We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another."
"Tradition wears a snowy beard, romance is always young."
"Today I begin to understand what love must be, if it exists... When we are parted, we each feel the lack of the other half of ourselves. We are incomplete like a book in two volumes of which the first has been lost. That is what I imagine love to be: incompleteness in absence."
I believe I can even yet remember when I saw the stars for the first time.
"I had these kind of unrealistic expectations that were fueled by romantic comedies, and it has both helped me and hurt me in many ways. It helped me because, in general, they've made me hopeful. I just figure things will eventually work out for me. But nobody is like any Tom Hanks character. Nobody is Hugh Grant. No one is Meg Ryan!"
"Some days are just bad days, that's all. You have to experience sadness to know happiness, and I remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day, that's just the way it is!"
"It's sad to know I'm done. But looking back, I've got a lot of great memories."
"Every human walks around with a certain kind of sadness. They may not wear it on their sleeves, but it's there if you look deep."
Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.
"The good times of today, are the sad thoughts of tomorrow."
"You can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. You don't fall in love with people because they're fun. It just happens."
"Let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts."
"Crying is cleansing. There's a reason for tears, happiness or sadness."
"It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure."
"Heavy hearts, like heavy clouds in the sky, are best relieved by the letting of a little water."
The word 'happy' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.
"Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise."
"First, accept sadness. Realize that without losing, winning isn't so great."
Nothing is more sad than the death of an illusion.
"Never make a decision when you are upset, sad, jealous or in love."
"There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love."
"I've cried, and you'd think I'd be better for it, but the sadness just sleeps, and it stays in my spine the rest of my life."
"Make the most of your regrets; never smother your sorrow, but tend and cherish it till it comes to have a separate and integral interest. To regret deeply is to live afresh."
We never taste a perfect joy; our happiest successes are mixed with sadness.
"When you feel sad, it's okay. It's not the end of the world. Everyone has those days when you doubt yourself, and when you feel like everything you do sucks, but then there's those days when you feel like Superman. It's just the balance of the world. I just write to feel better."
Depression is the inability to construct a future.
Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.
The sad truth is that opportunity doesn't knock twice.
"The tree I had in the garden as a child, my beech tree, I used to climb up there and spend hours. I took my homework up there, my books, I went up there if I was sad, and it just felt very good to be up there among the green leaves and the birds and the sky."
"Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever."
"To succeed in life, you need three things: a wishbone, a backbone and a funny bone."
"I love everything that's old, - old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine."
"I try to be grateful for the abundance of the blessings that I have, for the journey that I'm on and to relish each day as a gift."
"Our prayers should be for blessings in general, for God knows best what is good for us."
"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else."
I say luck is when an opportunity comes along and you're prepared for it.
The joyful heart sees and reads the world with a sense of freedom and graciousness.
"If it was raining soup, the Irish would go out with forks."
"Be true to your work, your word, and your friend."
We have always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English.
"You gotta try your luck at least once a day, because you could be going around lucky all day and not even know it."
"Think where man's glory most begins and ends, and say my glory was I had such friends."
Cherish your human connections: your relationships with friends and family.
"Being Irish, he had an abiding sense of tragedy, which sustained him through temporary periods of joy."
"Christ beside me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, Christ within me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me."
"A blessing is a circle of light drawn around a person to protect, heal and strengthen."
There is no language like the Irish for soothing and quieting.
Fond memory brings the light of other days around me.
Luck is believing you're lucky.
"Love is never defeated, and I could add, the history of Ireland proves it."
"Being Irish, I always had this love of words."
That's what the holidays are for - for one person to tell the stories and another to dispute them. Isn't that the Irish way?
"I come from an Irish Catholic family, and hell-raising is part of the DNA."
"Geographically, Ireland is a medium-sized rural island that is slowly but steadily being consumed by sheep."
"Above all else, deep in my soul, I'm a tough Irishwoman."
Being Irish is very much a part of who I am. I take it everywhere with me.
There are no shortcuts in evolution.
"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."
"Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result."
The science of today is the technology of tomorrow.
"We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology."
"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."
The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.
"Science is not only a disciple of reason but, also, one of romance and passion."
The art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge.
Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.
"Modern science says: 'The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon is the future.' From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom."
Science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of the intelligence.
Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition.
"On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we gain no scientific explanation."
No science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power.
"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."
We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology.
"Once you have an innovation culture, even those who are not scientists or engineers - poets, actors, journalists - they, as communities, embrace the meaning of what it is to be scientifically literate. They embrace the concept of an innovation culture. They vote in ways that promote it. They don't fight science and they don't fight technology."
Anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words: 'Ye must have faith.'
"To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science."
The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success.
Science does not know its debt to imagination.
"The cloning of humans is on most of the lists of things to worry about from Science, along with behaviour control, genetic engineering, transplanted heads, computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic flowers."
Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.
Science may have found a cure for most evils; but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all - the apathy of human beings.
Romance should never begin with sentiment. It should begin with science and end with a settlement.
If you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love.
Smile in the mirror. Do that every morning and you'll start to see a big difference in your life.
"Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love."
Your smile will give you a positive countenance that will make people feel comfortable around you.
Nothing you wear is more important than your smile.
A smile is the universal welcome.
"The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection."
Beauty is power; a smile is its sword.
A smile is happiness you'll find right under your nose.
"A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles."
"I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death."
"The greatest self is a peaceful smile, that always sees the world smiling back."
"I love a man with a great sense of humor and who is intelligent - a man who has a great smile. He has to make me laugh. I like a man who is very ambitious and driven and who has a good heart and makes me feel safe. I like a man who is very strong and independent and confident - that is very sexy - but at the same time, he's very kind to people."
"Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth."
We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do.
A warm smile is the universal language of kindness.
Share your smile with the world. It's a symbol of friendship and peace.
"Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come."
Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.
Start every day off with a smile and get it over with.
"You take away all the other luxuries in life, and if you can make someone smile and laugh, you have given the most special gift: happiness."
"Lighten up, just enjoy life, smile more, laugh more, and don't get so worked up about things."
Peace begins with a smile.
Colors are the smiles of nature.
"Let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts."
Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.
"There is pleasure in the pathless woods, there is rapture in the lonely shore, there is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar; I love not Man the less, but Nature more."
"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."
"You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty."
"We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology."
"Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family."
"We should be concerned not only about the health of individual patients, but also the health of our entire society."
"Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work."
The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.
"Weakness is what brings ignorance, cheapness, racism, homophobia, desperation, cruelty, brutality, all these things that will keep a society chained to the ground, one foot nailed to the floor."
Where do the evils like corruption arise from? It comes from the never-ending greed. The fight for corruption-free ethical society will have to be fought against this greed and replace it with 'what can I give' spirit.
"If you're white and you're wrong, then you're wrong; if you're black and you're wrong, you're wrong. People are people. Black, blue, pink, green - God make no rules about color; only society make rules where my people suffer, and that why we must have redemption and redemption now."
I say what I want to say and do what I want to do. There's no in between. People will either love you for it or hate you for it.
"We have to be bold in our national ambitions. First, we must win the fight against poverty within the next decade. Second, we must improve moral standards in government and society to provide a strong foundation for good governance. Third, we must change the character of our politics to promote fertile ground for reforms."
"Because power corrupts, society's demands for moral authority and character increase as the importance of the position increases."
"As I often say, we have come a long way from the days of slavery, but in 2014, discrimination and inequality still saturate our society in modern ways. Though racism may be less blatant now in many cases, its existence is undeniable."
"We must reject the idea that every time a law's broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions."
"For too long, our society has shrugged off bullying by labeling it a 'rite of passage' and by asking students to simply 'get over it.' Those attitudes need to change. Every day, students are bullied into silence and are afraid to speak up. Let's break this silence and end school bullying."
"Unless and until our society recognizes cyber bullying for what it is, the suffering of thousands of silent victims will continue."
"People who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses, or the problems of modern society."
"We live in the kind of society where, in almost all cases, hard work is rewarded."
"The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal, not merely a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society."
Tremendous amounts of talent are lost to our society just because that talent wears a skirt.
"If we desire a society of peace, then we cannot achieve such a society through violence. If we desire a society without discrimination, then we must not discriminate against anyone in the process of building this society. If we desire a society that is democratic, then democracy must become a means as well as an end."
"If we desire a society in which men are brothers, then we must act towards one another with brotherhood. If we can build such a society, then we would have achieved the ultimate goal of human freedom."
"I know that war and mayhem run in our blood. I refuse to believe that they must dominate our lives. We humans are animals, too, but animals with amazing powers of rationality, morality, society. We can use our strength and courage not to savage each other, but to defend our highest purposes."
I think the ideology of the Congress is closest to mine. Congress is a party where I should be. I have joined politics to bring change in society. The Congress gave me a chance with the Aadhaar project. It's a party that will allow me to bring change.
"You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space."
The real lover is the man who can thrill you just by touching your head or smiling into your eyes - or just by staring into space.
Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.
"There is always space for improvement, no matter how long you've been in the business."
Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again.
"Modern science says: 'The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon is the future.' From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom."
"Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country."
"When we contemplate the whole globe as one great dewdrop, striped and dotted with continents and islands, flying through space with other stars all singing and shining together as one, the whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty."
"Don't even try to talk to me when I'm watching the moon. That's my moon, baby."
"One in 200 stars has habitable Earth-like planets surrounding it - in the galaxy, half a billion stars have Earth-like planets going around them - that's huge, half a billion. So when we look at the night sky, it makes sense that someone is looking back at us."
"Time and space - time to be alone, space to move about - these may well become the great scarcities of tomorrow."
"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."
"Before we had airplanes and astronauts, we really thought that there was an actual place beyond the clouds, somewhere over the rainbow. There was an actual place, and we could go above the clouds and find it there."
"In spite of the opinions of certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon this globe, as within some magic circle it must never outstep, we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the same facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from Liverpool to New York!"
"In order for us to have a future that's exciting and inspiring, it has to be one where we're a space-bearing civilization."
"Something I like to do a lot is just sit by water when there's a current and just stare into the water. I don't fish, I don't hunt, I don't scuba, I don't spear, don't boat, don't play basketball or football - I excel at staring into space. I'm really good at that."
"NASA is an engine of innovation and inspiration as well as the world's premier space exploration agency, and we are well served by politicians working to keep it that way, instead of turning it into a mere jobs program, or worse, cutting its budget."
"Pleasure is a shadow, wealth is vanity, and power a pageant; but knowledge is ecstatic in enjoyment, perennial in frame, unlimited in space and indefinite in duration."
Love is space and time measured by the heart.
"If you look at the Earth without architecture, it's sometimes a little bit unpleasant. So there is this basic human need to do shelter in the broadest sense of the word, whether it's a movie theater or a simple log cabin in the mountains. This is the core of architecture: To provide a space for human beings."
"People need to know that they have all the tools within themselves. Self-awareness, which means awareness of their body, awareness of their mental space, awareness of their relationships - not only with each other, but with life and the ecosystem."
Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people.
You cannot look up at the night sky on the Planet Earth and not wonder what it's like to be up there amongst the stars. And I always look up at the moon and see it as the single most romantic place within the cosmos.
"By refocusing our space program on Mars for America's future, we can restore the sense of wonder and adventure in space exploration that we knew in the summer of 1969. We won the moon race; now it's time for us to live and work on Mars, first on its moons and then on its surface."
"Space Mountain may be the oldest ride in the park, but it has the longest line."
"Each time I think I've created time for myself, along comes a throwback to disrupt my private space."
"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."
Success is where preparation and opportunity meet.
Just play. Have fun. Enjoy the game.
Football is football and talent is talent. But the mindset of your team makes all the difference.
Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after.
"There's three things men always talk about - women, sports, and cars."
"You can't put a limit on anything. The more you dream, the farther you get."
"Apart from education, you need good health, and for that, you need to play sports."
Sports do not build character. They reveal it.
Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
"It is not up to me whether I win or lose. Ultimately, this might not be my day. And it is that philosophy towards sports, something that I really truly live by. I am emotional. I want to win. I am hungry. I am a competitor. I have that fire. But deep down, I truly enjoy the art of competing so much more than the result."
"Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing."
"The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge, place I've always gone where I needed comfort and peace. It's been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction. It's a relationship that has evolved over time, given me the greatest respect and love for the game."
The best kids are going to become the best. But the best thing about it is that you're going to learn lessons in playing those sports about winning and losing and teamwork and teammates and arguments and everything else that are going to affect you positively for the rest of your life.
"The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime."
It's good sportsmanship to not pick up lost golf balls while they are still rolling.
"Regardless of the obstacles or hurdles that are ahead of you, regardless of the opponent, regardless of the odds, your goal and objective always is to win. I think that's part of sports."
"It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up."
Winners never quit and quitters never win.
"Gold medals aren't really made of gold. They're made of sweat, determination, and a hard-to-find alloy called guts."
"Give me golf clubs, fresh air and a beautiful partner, and you can keep the clubs and the fresh air."
"If it doesn't matter who wins or loses, then why do they keep score?"
I see great things in baseball. It's our game - the American game.
"Sports are such a great teacher. I think of everything they've taught me: camaraderie, humility, how to resolve differences."
A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be.
"You always get a special kick on opening day, no matter how many you go through. You look forward to it like a birthday party when you're a kid. You think something wonderful is going to happen."
"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
"Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world."
"The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection."
"When you rise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life, for your strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies in yourself."
"I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death."
"You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.'"
"Unity is strength... when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved."
"Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm."
My family is my strength and my weakness.
"Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved."
Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle.
No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.
"Calm mind brings inner strength and self-confidence, so that's very important for good health."
"The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places."
Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.
Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential.
Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.
War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
"Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength."
Silence is a source of great strength.
"Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this, that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak."
A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.
Great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance.
Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect.
"There are dark shadows on the earth, but its lights are stronger in the contrast."

Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.
"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful."
"Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."
A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success!
"Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It's about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others' success, and then standing back and letting them shine."
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.
"There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."
"Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it."
"Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success."
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.
"All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence, and then success is sure."
"Success is not a good teacher, failure makes you humble."
"The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand."
Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.
Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.
Success is where preparation and opportunity meet.
"Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved."
Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome.
"The road to success is not easy to navigate, but with hard work, drive and passion, it's possible to achieve the American dream."
"Success is simple. Do what's right, the right way, at the right time."
Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.
"The purpose of human life is to serve, and to show compassion and the will to help others."
What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. It has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy. It has eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like.
There is no pain so great as the memory of joy in present grief.
"We should feel sorrow, but not sink under its oppression."
"What is lovely never dies, But passes into other loveliness."
A sympathetic friend can be quite as dear as a brother.
"If our hearts are ready for anything, we can open to our inevitable losses, and to the depths of our sorrow. We can grieve our lost loves, our lost youth, our lost health, our lost capacities. This is part of our humanness, part of the expression of our love for life."
"The rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between them, each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other, always using friendly and sincere words."
"No one has yet realized the wealth of sympathy, the kindness and generosity hidden in the soul of a child. The effort of every true education should be to unlock that treasure."
"I believe that we must reach our brother, never toning down our fundamental oppositions, but meeting him when he asks to be met, with a reason for the faith that is in us, as well as with a loving sympathy for them as brothers."
"Women ought to feel a peculiar sympathy in the colored man's wrong, for, like him, she has been accused of mental inferiority, and denied the privileges of a liberal education."
There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery.
"Grief changes shape, but it never ends."
Grief is the price we pay for love.
"Come away, O human child: To the waters and the wild with a fairy, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand."
"No matter how prepared you think you are for the death of a loved one, it still comes as a shock, and it still hurts very deeply."
"Happiness is beneficial for the body, but it is grief that develops the powers of the mind."
"Pity may represent little more than the impersonal concern which prompts the mailing of a check, but true sympathy is the personal concern which demands the giving of one's soul."
Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.
"After you have wept and grieved for your physical losses, cherish the functions and the life you have left."
Autumn wins you best by this its mute appeal to sympathy for its decay.
"One might expect that the families of murder victims would be showered with sympathy and support, embraced by their communities. But in reality they are far more likely to feel isolated, fearful, and ashamed, overwhelmed by grief and guilt, angry at the criminal-justice system, and shunned by their old friends."
Children require guidance and sympathy far more than instruction.
We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living.
"Unable are the loved to die, for love is immortality."
"Let us remember: One book, one pen, one child, and one teacher can change the world."
"A good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination, and instill a love of learning."
"Success is not a good teacher, failure makes you humble."
Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.
"Mama was my greatest teacher, a teacher of compassion, love and fearlessness. If love is sweet as a flower, then my mother is that sweet flower of love."
"Teaching is a very noble profession that shapes the character, caliber, and future of an individual. If the people remember me as a good teacher, that will be the biggest honour for me."
"Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important."
"If a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds, I strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference. They are the father, the mother and the teacher."
My father was my teacher. But most importantly he was a great dad.
It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
"In the practice of tolerance, one's enemy is the best teacher."
"It's the teacher that makes the difference, not the classroom."
A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.
I like a teacher who gives you something to take home to think about besides homework.
"The dream begins with a teacher who believes in you, who tugs and pushes and leads you to the next plateau, sometimes poking you with a sharp stick called 'truth'."
"None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. We got here because somebody - a parent, a teacher, an Ivy League crony or a few nuns - bent down and helped us pick up our boots."
"Education is the key to success in life, and teachers make a lasting impact in the lives of their students."
Good teachers know how to bring out the best in students.
"Heroes represent the best of ourselves, respecting that we are human beings. A hero can be anyone from Gandhi to your classroom teacher, anyone who can show courage when faced with a problem. A hero is someone who is willing to help others in his or her best capacity."
Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching.
The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.
"I have learned that, although I am a good teacher, I am a much better student, and I was blessed to learn valuable lessons from my students on a daily basis. They taught me the importance of teaching to a student - and not to a test."
"I was born 50 years after slavery, in 1913. I was allowed to read. My mother, who was a teacher, taught me when I was a very young child. The first school I attended was a small building that went from first to sixth grade. There was one teacher for all of the students. There could be anywhere from 50 to 60 students of all different ages."
"I am a teacher. It's how I define myself. A good teacher isn't someone who gives the answers out to their kids but is understanding of needs and challenges and gives tools to help other people succeed. That's the way I see myself, so whatever it is that I will do eventually after politics, it'll have to do a lot with teaching."
"I have learned silence from the talkative, toleration from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind; yet, strange, I am ungrateful to those teachers."
What we become depends on what we read after all of the professors have finished with us. The greatest university of all is a collection of books.
It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.
"Technology can be our best friend, and technology can also be the biggest party pooper of our lives. It interrupts our own story, interrupts our ability to have a thought or a daydream, to imagine something wonderful, because we're too busy bridging the walk from the cafeteria back to the office on the cell phone."
"Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important."
The science of today is the technology of tomorrow.
"We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology."
"Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them."
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
Men have become the tools of their tools.
Social media is not about the exploitation of technology but service to community.
"The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive. It lets people learn things they didn't think they could learn before, and so in a sense it is all about potential."
"From computers to information technology to airplanes, it has been America's unique blend of republican government and free-market capitalism that has allowed us to surpass all other nations in history."
We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology.
"It's impossible to move, to live, to operate at any level without leaving traces, bits, seemingly meaningless fragments of personal information."
"Once you have an innovation culture, even those who are not scientists or engineers - poets, actors, journalists - they, as communities, embrace the meaning of what it is to be scientifically literate. They embrace the concept of an innovation culture. They vote in ways that promote it. They don't fight science and they don't fight technology."
"Traits acquired during one's lifetime - muscles built up in the gym, for example - cannot be passed on to the next generation. Now with technology, as it happens, we might indeed be able to transfer some of our acquired traits on to our selected offspring by genetic engineering."
"Our technological powers increase, but the side effects and potential hazards also escalate."
"The Internet is so big, so powerful and pointless that for some people it is a complete substitute for life."
"The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it. But it's like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out. They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment."
"Technology gives us the facilities that lessen the barriers of time and distance - the telegraph and cable, the telephone, radio, and the rest."
"We already have - thanks to technology, development, skills, the efficiency of our work - enough resources to satisfy all human needs. But we don't have enough resources, and we are unlikely ever to have, to satisfy human greed."
"Did you ever spell a word so bad that your spell check has absolutely no clue what you're trying to spell? What do you end up getting, you end up getting, like, a question mark. You got a million dollars of technology just looking back at you like, 'You got me, buddy. Which is pretty amazing because I have all the words.'"
Genetically modified organism (GMO) foods are feared and hated by environmentalists and the public alike. Yet the scientific assessment of GMOs is remarkably different. Every major scientific evaluation of GMO technology has concluded that GMOs are safe for human consumption and are a benefit to the environment.
"In the industrial revolution Britain led the world in advances that enabled mass production: trade exchanges, transportation, factory technology and new skills needed for the new industrialised world."
"I am a huge fan of capitalism and a huge fan of entrepreneurship and changing the world with technology and with entrepreneurship. Capitalism is awesome. To me, capitalism is my religion."
The technology at the leading edge changes so rapidly that you have to keep current after you get out of school. I think probably the most important thing is having good fundamentals.
"Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change."
"Being a teen can be tough. Just try to surround yourself with really good friends that really have your back, and also be a really good friend to those who really care about you. If you're not sure about certain things, talk to your friends that you trust and your family."
Good habits formed at youth make all the difference.
"Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life."
Keep true to the dreams of your youth.
I was a happy kid up until I hit the teen years.
It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.
You have teenagers thinking they're going to make millions as NBA stars when that's not realistic for even 1 percent of them. Becoming a scientist or engineer is.
"Adolescents are not monsters. They are just people trying to learn how to make it among the adults in the world, who are probably not so sure themselves."
Being a teenager is an amazing time and a hard time. It's when you make your best friends - I have girls who will never leave my heart and I still talk to. You get the best and the worst as a teen. You have the best friendships and the worst heartbreaks.
There is a point in every young person's life when you realize that the youth that you've progressed through and graduate to some sort of adulthood is equally as messed up as where you're going.
"Friendships in childhood are usually a matter of chance, whereas in adolescence they are most often a matter of choice."
Adolescence is the conjugator of childhood and adulthood.
I actually love writing for teens best. I had such an awful time in my own teen years - I love having the chance to relive them through my fiction.
"When I was growing up, my parents told me, 'Finish your dinner. People in China and India are starving.' I tell my daughters, 'Finish your homework. People in India and China are starving for your job.'"
As a teenager you are at the last stage in your life when you will be happy to hear that the phone is for you.
"To all those mothers and fathers who are struggling with teen-agers, I say, just be patient: even though it looks like you can't do anything right for a number of years, parents become popular again when kids reach 20."
Adolescence isn't just about prom or wearing sparkly dresses.
"We won a contest at the teen fair in Vancouver and the first prize was a recording contract and we recorded at a radio station on the stairway, and we did a record and it got put out."
I love being a teen because you don't have all the responsibilities of an adult yet.
As a teenager I was so insecure. I was the type of guy that never fitted in because he never dared to choose. I was convinced I had absolutely no talent at all. For nothing. And that thought took away all my ambition too.
"The area of teenage life is not necessarily rarefied; we've all gone through that period. It's not as rarefied as a western or a space adventure or a gangster film, but it has its own dynamic."
"I didn't know what was going to happen with 'Teen Wolf.' I was only scheduled to do four episodes for them, but they kept me on, and I was like, 'Sweet! I'm still employed! That's awesome!' And then, they let me know that they were considering having me for the second half of the season."
"I don't believe in 'thinking' old. Although I've transitioned through many bodies - a baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, mid-life and older adult - my spirit is unchanged. I support my body with exercise, my mind with reading and writing, and my spirit with the knowing that I am part of the Divine source of all life."
Telling a teenager the facts of life is like giving a fish a bath.
Maturity is only a short break in adolescence.
My teenage years were exactly what they were supposed to be. Everybody has their own path. It's laid out for you. It's just up to you to walk it.
"When you rise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life, for your strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies in yourself."
"Be true to yourself, help others, make each day your masterpiece, make friendship a fine art, drink deeply from good books - especially the Bible, build a shelter against a rainy day, give thanks for your blessings and pray for guidance every day."
"Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough."
"I was given such a great gift. It's a miracle that never stops amazing me and reminding me to give thanks, every day. Having a wife and daughter gives me a lot more purpose. I was much more selfish before, but now I think about what kind of role model I'll be. I just want to be a better man."
"Many times, the decisions we make affect and hurt your closest friends and family the most. I have a lot of regrets in that regard. But God has forgiven me, which I am very thankful for. It has enabled me to forgive myself and move forward one day at a time."
"Let me encourage you to get up every day and focus on what you do have in life. Be thankful for the blessings of the little things, even when you don't get what you expect."
"Make it a habit to tell people thank you. To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return. Truly appreciate those around you, and you'll soon find many others around you. Truly appreciate life, and you'll find that you have more of it."
"I'm just thankful for everything, all the blessings in my life, trying to stay that way. I think that's the best way to start your day and finish your day. It keeps everything in perspective."
"Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow."
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.
"When you practice gratefulness, there is a sense of respect toward others."
"I wouldn't change anything. I've made mistakes, but thanks to those mistakes, I've learned."
"In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit."
At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us.
"When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around."
"There's no happier person than a truly thankful, content person."
"If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough."
I feel grateful because I have a lot of love in my life. I found the person I'm sharing my life with. I have a good man.
"Thanksgiving is a time when the world gets to see just how blessed and how workable the Christian system is. The emphasis is not on giving or buying, but on being thankful and expressing that appreciation to God and to one another."
"'Thank you' is the best prayer that anyone could say. I say that one a lot. Thank you expresses extreme gratitude, humility, understanding."
"Whatever we are waiting for - peace of mind, contentment, grace, the inner awareness of simple abundance - it will surely come to us, but only when we are ready to receive it with an open and grateful heart."
"Thank you for life, and all the little ups and downs that make it worth living."
"We in the United States should be all the more thankful for the freedom and religious tolerance we enjoy. And we should always remember the lessons learned from the Holocaust, in hopes we stay vigilant against such inhumanity now and in the future."
"Before I get out of bed, I am saying thank you. I know how important it is to be thankful."
"Be grateful for what you have and stop complaining - it bores everybody else, does you no good, and doesn't solve any problems."
I'm thankful for every moment.
"Some memories are unforgettable, remaining ever vivid and heartwarming!"
"Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough."
"Thanksgiving is a time when the world gets to see just how blessed and how workable the Christian system is. The emphasis is not on giving or buying, but on being thankful and expressing that appreciation to God and to one another."
Thanksgiving just gets me all warm and tingly and all kinds of wonderful inside.
"Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings."
"The truth is the Super Bowl long ago became more than just a football game. It's part of our culture like turkey at Thanksgiving and lights at Christmas, and like those holidays beyond their meaning, a factor in our economy."
"Vegetables are a must on a diet. I suggest carrot cake, zucchini bread, and pumpkin pie."
I'm thankful for every moment.
Thanksgiving dinners take eighteen hours to prepare. They are consumed in twelve minutes. Half-times take twelve minutes. This is not coincidence.
"My most memorable meal is every Thanksgiving. I love the food: the turkey and stuffing; the sweet potatoes and rice, which come from my mother's Southern heritage; the mashed potatoes, which come from my wife's Midwestern roots; the Campbell's green-bean casserole; and of course, pumpkin pie."
"Christmas is more stressful with present buying and making sure everyone gets included, but Thanksgiving is really not that. I don't ever really get stressed out about the food."
"Thanksgiving, man. Not a good day to be my pants."
My fondest memories are generally the day after Thanksgiving. I get the total decorating Christmas itch.
I give thanks to my Creator for this wonderful life where each of us has the opportunity to learn lessons we could not fully comprehend by any other means.
Over and over I marvel at the blessings of my life: Each year has grown better than the last.
There is one day that is ours. Thanksgiving Day is the one day that is purely American.
For what I have received may the Lord make me truly thankful. And more truly for what I have not received.
"On Thanksgiving I will stop to give thanks that my family is safe and healthy, especially because I realize that, following the tragedies of this year, it is all too real a possibility that they might not have been."
"One of the best parts of Thanksgiving for me is re-watching some of the classic holiday blunders that have been depicted on television. I remember laughing uncontrollably on the set of 'That Girl' back in 1967 when we shot the episode, 'Thanksgiving Comes But Once A Year, Hopefully' during our second season."
"Every Thanksgiving, we all write down three things we're thankful for and put them in a hat. Then we pass the hat around the dinner table and everyone has to guess who wrote what!"
"You may have heard of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. There's another day you might want to know about: Giving Tuesday. The idea is pretty straightforward. On the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, shoppers take a break from their gift-buying and donate what they can to charity."
"Pride slays thanksgiving, but a humble mind is the soil out of which thanks naturally grow. A proud man is seldom a grateful man, for he never thinks he gets as much as he deserves."
An optimist is a person who starts a new diet on Thanksgiving Day.
Thanksgiving is a season that is very much in accord with the themes and teachings of Jesus Christ.
"Halloween is fun, but it wasn't always my favorite holiday. I think Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday."
"Christmas is a huge thing in my family. We usually start decorating the day after Thanksgiving. We spend Christmas Eve with one set of grandparents, and Christmas Day with the other grandparents and our family."
"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored."
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
My dream is of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last best hope of earth.
"Let us never know what old age is. Let us know the happiness time brings, not count the years."
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition."
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.
A friend is what the heart needs all the time.
The time is always right to do what is right.
"I love a man with a great sense of humor and who is intelligent - a man who has a great smile. He has to make me laugh. I like a man who is very ambitious and driven and who has a good heart and makes me feel safe. I like a man who is very strong and independent and confident - that is very sexy - but at the same time, he's very kind to people."
"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."
"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."
"Christmas is the perfect time to celebrate the love of God and family and to create memories that will last forever. Jesus is God's perfect, indescribable gift. The amazing thing is that not only are we able to receive this gift, but we are able to share it with others on Christmas and every other day of the year."
"Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity."
Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.
"Each time you love, love as deeply as if it were forever."
"And know that I am with you always; yes, to the end of time."
Never cut a tree down in the wintertime. Never make a negative decision in the low time. Never make your most important decisions when you are in your worst moods. Wait. Be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come.
"Success is simple. Do what's right, the right way, at the right time."
The time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself.
"You can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. You don't fall in love with people because they're fun. It just happens."
It is not the beauty of a building you should look at; its the construction of the foundation that will stand the test of time.
"You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space."
"Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."
"It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure."
I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people.
"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page."
"Wherever you go, go with all your heart."
"A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving."
"Success comes to those who dedicate everything to their passion in life. To be successful, it is also very important to be humble and never let fame or money travel to your head."
"Every day is a journey, and the journey itself is home."
To travel is to take a journey into yourself.
"I see my path, but I don't know where it leads. Not knowing where I'm going is what inspires me to travel it."
Exploration is really the essence of the human spirit.
A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.
It is better to travel well than to arrive.
"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes."
A man travels the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it.
"We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls."
"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."
"We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend."
The everyday kindness of the back roads more than makes up for the acts of greed in the headlines.
Travel can be one of the most rewarding forms of introspection.
How often I found where I should be going only by setting out for somewhere else.
"In spite of the opinions of certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon this globe, as within some magic circle it must never outstep, we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the same facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from Liverpool to New York!"
"Even if it turns out that time travel is impossible, it is important that we understand why it is impossible."
"If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success."
"A man who leaves home to mend himself and others is a philosopher; but he who goes from country to country, guided by the blind impulse of curiosity, is a vagabond."
"If you wish to travel far and fast, travel light. Take off all your envies, jealousies, unforgiveness, selfishness and fears."
The traveller has reached the end of the journey!
"Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the elder, a part of experience."
"Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends."
"Love myself I do. Not everything, but I love the good as well as the bad. I love my crazy lifestyle, and I love my hard discipline. I love my freedom of speech and the way my eyes get dark when I'm tired. I love that I have learned to trust people with my heart, even if it will get broken. I am proud of everything that I am and will become."
"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."
"I believe if you keep your faith, you keep your trust, you keep the right attitude, if you're grateful, you'll see God open up new doors."
Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.
"Trust in dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity."
"I believe that a trusting attitude and a patient attitude go hand in hand. You see, when you let go and learn to trust God, it releases joy in your life. And when you trust God, you're able to be more patient. Patience is not just about waiting for something... it's about how you wait, or your attitude while waiting."
"I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose. There are no accidents; we're all teachers - if we're willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn, trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks or wait for some miracle to come knocking at our door."
"A wedding anniversary is the celebration of love, trust, partnership, tolerance and tenacity. The order varies for any given year."
"Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come."
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.
Loyalty and devotion lead to bravery. Bravery leads to the spirit of self-sacrifice. The spirit of self-sacrifice creates trust in the power of love.
"In finding love, I think it's important to be patient. In being in a relationship, I think it's important to be honest, to communicate, to respect and trust, and to strive to give more than you take."
The friend in my adversity I shall always cherish most. I can better trust those who helped to relieve the gloom of my dark hours than those who are so ready to enjoy with me the sunshine of my prosperity.
To be trusted is a greater compliment than being loved.
"For every good reason there is to lie, there is a better reason to tell the truth."
The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.
A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.
"Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement."
Honor bespeaks worth. Confidence begets trust. Service brings satisfaction. Cooperation proves the quality of leadership.
The trust of the innocent is the liar's most useful tool.
"Peer pressure is something everyone will face in school. You have to really go by what you think is the right thing to do. Turn to the friends you trust the most when you are put in a compromising situation. If your friends are making the wrong decision, then turn to your parents."
"Being a teen can be tough. Just try to surround yourself with really good friends that really have your back, and also be a really good friend to those who really care about you. If you're not sure about certain things, talk to your friends that you trust and your family."
"Trust, but verify."
"To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float."
"Basically, there are two paths you can walk: faith or fear. It's impossible to simultaneously trust God and not trust God."
Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships.
"Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love."
Truth is everybody is going to hurt you: you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for.
Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.
"Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth."
"Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth."
I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.
Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
The goal of education is the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of truth.
"The truth is you don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. Life is a crazy ride, and nothing is guaranteed."
"Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."
Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.
"I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against."
The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. Lies will pass into history.
"For every good reason there is to lie, there is a better reason to tell the truth."
A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.
All truth is simple... is that not doubly a lie?
"A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth."
Truth is powerful and it prevails.
"I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies."
Morality is the basis of things and truth is the substance of all morality.
We learned about honesty and integrity - that the truth matters... that you don't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules... and success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square.
"The dream begins with a teacher who believes in you, who tugs and pushes and leads you to the next plateau, sometimes poking you with a sharp stick called 'truth'."
All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.
"Truth is, I'll never know all there is to know about you just as you will never know all there is to know about me. Humans are by nature too complicated to be understood fully. So, we can choose either to approach our fellow human beings with suspicion or to approach them with an open mind, a dash of optimism and a great deal of candour."
Perhaps the truth depends on a walk around the lake.
"Some people think that the truth can be hidden with a little cover-up and decoration. But as time goes by, what is true is revealed, and what is fake fades away."
"If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you."
All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt.
If you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love.
"For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul."
Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.
They invented hugs to let people know you love them without saying anything.
"Where there is great love, there are always wishes."
Love will find a way through paths where wolves fear to prey.
"If you press me to say why I loved him, I can say no more than because he was he, and I was I."
A kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the years.
When you love someone all your saved up wishes start coming out.
We are most alive when we're in love.
"A friendship that like love is warm; A love like friendship, steady."
"I know of only one duty, and that is to love."
I'd rather have roses on my table than diamonds on my neck.
The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.
"You are always new, the last of your kisses was ever the sweetest."
"A heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others."
"Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love."
"The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along."
"There's a long life ahead of you and it's going to be beautiful, as long as you keep loving and hugging each other."
Love shall be our token; love be yours and love be mine.
"How did it happen that their lips came together? How does it happen that birds sing, that snow melts, that the rose unfolds, that the dawn whitens behind the stark shapes of trees on the quivering summit of the hill? A kiss, and all was said."
"This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet."
"Now a soft kiss - Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss."
"Romance is thinking about your significant other, when you are supposed to be thinking about something else."
"True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost."
"There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty, that makes human nature rise above itself, in acts of bravery and heroism."
The Lord gets his best soldiers out of the highlands of affliction.
I go where the sound of thunder is.
"Every soldier must know, before he goes into battle, how the little battle he is to fight fits into the larger picture, and how the success of his fighting will influence the battle as a whole."
"On this Veterans Day, let us remember the service of our veterans, and let us renew our national promise to fulfill our sacred obligations to our veterans and their families who have sacrificed so much so that we can live free."
"Duty, Honor, Country. Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be."
The veterans of our military services have put their lives on the line to protect the freedoms that we enjoy. They have dedicated their lives to their country and deserve to be recognized for their commitment.
"Live as brave men; and if fortune is adverse, front its blows with brave hearts."
"The valor and courage of our young women and men in the armed services are a shining example to all of the world, and we owe them and their families our deepest respect."
In war the heroes always outnumber the soldiers ten to one.
It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived.
"Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death."
Honoring the sacrifices many have made for our country in the name of freedom and democracy is the very foundation of Veterans Day.
"Brave men rejoice in adversity, just as brave soldiers triumph in war."
"When the will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, when honor scorns to compromise with death - that is heroism."
"The sanctity of our battlefields, monuments, and veterans institutions is of utmost importance to preserve military history and pay respect to those who fought."
"Well, look at what people are doing for returned veterans now. The wounded warriors. They're working hard to make the wounded veterans feel that they are loved and welcomed home, unlike Vietnam. It was not a very kind, gentle world then. I think we are kinder and gentler."
"The soldier above all others prays for peace, for it is the soldier who must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war."
Never wear your best trousers when you go out to fight for freedom and truth.
"I offer neither pay, nor quarters, nor food; I offer only hunger, thirst, forced marches, battles and death. Let him who loves his country with his heart, and not merely with his lips, follow me."
"But this Veterans Day, I believe we should do more than sing the praises of the bravery and patriotism that our veterans have embodied in the past. We should take this opportunity to re-evaluate how we are treating our veterans in the present."
A few honest men are better than numbers.
"Soldiers, when committed to a task, can't compromise. It's unrelenting devotion to the standards of duty and courage, absolute loyalty to others, not letting the task go until it's been done."
America's Veterans have served their country with the belief that democracy and freedom are ideals to be upheld around the world.
"Our soldiers have nobly fought to protect freedom since our country's birth, and have fought to protect those that could not protect themselves, even in foreign lands when called upon."
The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.
I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.
"Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories."
Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.
"Even today we raise our hand against our brother... We have perfected our weapons, our conscience has fallen asleep, and we have sharpened our ideas to justify ourselves as if it were normal we continue to sow destruction, pain, death. Violence and war lead only to death."
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.
War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his.
The lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis is plain: Strength prevents war; weakness invites it. We need a commander-in-chief who understands that - and who won't leave us facing a foe who thinks he doesn't.
I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy.
To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.
The condition of man... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone.
"European nations began World War I with a glamorous vision of war, only to be psychologically shattered by the realities of the trenches. The experience changed the way people referred to the glamour of battle; they treated it no longer as a positive quality but as a dangerous illusion."
"If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known, that we are at all times ready for War."
"I saw courage both in the Vietnam War and in the struggle to stop it. I learned that patriotism includes protest, not just military service."
"Be at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every new year find you a better man."
"Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up."
"An Atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church. An atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said. An atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death. He wants disease conquered, poverty vanished, war eliminated."
"I was drafted during the Korean War. None of us wanted to go... It was only a couple of years after World War II had ended. We said, 'Wait a second? Didn't we just get through with that?'"
"Build me a son, O Lord, who will be strong enough to know when he is weak, and brave enough to face himself when he is afraid, one who will be proud and unbending in honest defeat, and humble and gentle in victory."
Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best; it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood.
"The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable."
"I know that war and mayhem run in our blood. I refuse to believe that they must dominate our lives. We humans are animals, too, but animals with amazing powers of rationality, morality, society. We can use our strength and courage not to savage each other, but to defend our highest purposes."
"People never lie so much as after a hunt, during a war or before an election."
"My first wish is to see this plague of mankind, war, banished from the earth."
"My father was very disappointed by war and fighting. And he thought language could help us out of cycles of revenge and animosity. And so, as a journalist, he always found himself asking lots of questions and trying to gather information. He was always very clear to underscore the fact that Jewish people and Arab people were brother and sister."
"A wedding anniversary is the celebration of love, trust, partnership, tolerance and tenacity. The order varies for any given year."
"The real act of marriage takes place in the heart, not in the ballroom or church or synagogue. It's a choice you make - not just on your wedding day, but over and over again - and that choice is reflected in the way you treat your husband or wife."
"There's a big difference between falling in love with someone and falling in love with someone and getting married. Usually, after you get married, you fall in love with the person even more."
"Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness, of hatred, of jealousy, and, most easily of all, the gate of fear."
A wedding dress is both an intimate and personal for a woman - it must reflect the personality and style of the bride.
"It's a funny thing that when a man hasn't anything on earth to worry about, he goes off and gets married."
A wedding is a funeral where you smell your own flowers.
"It's important to still look like yourself on your wedding day, so I didn't do anything drastic."
Bride: A woman with a fine prospect of happiness behind her.
"My mother says I didn't open my eyes for eight days after I was born, but when I did, the first thing I saw was an engagement ring. I was hooked."
A bride at her second marriage does not wear a veil. She wants to see what she is getting.
A young bride is like a plucked flower; but a guilty wife is like a flower that had been walked over.
I believe that anybody who gets married should go to a counselor for months before the wedding. I think that's going to save guys a lot of money and the ladies a lot of heartbreak.
"When I design a wedding dress with a bustle, it has to be one the bride can dance in. I love the idea that something is practical and still looks great."
You may invite the entire 35th Division to your wedding if you want to. I guess it's going to be yours as well as mine. We might as well have the church full while we are at it.
"About 80 percent of the photos on Flickr are public and searchable by everyone. In one sense, it's a place where people upload snapshots from the family reunion, wedding or the birth of a baby or something like that, but it's also a place where people go to show what the world looks like to them."
Christmas carols always brought tears to my eyes. I also cry at weddings. I should have cried at a couple of my own.
I'm getting married because I'm in love with a girl and want to spend my life with her. You can't live your life doing what other people want you to or you'll be miserable. At some point you just have to be yourself.
"My father always wanted to be the corpse at every funeral, the bride at every wedding and the baby at every christening."
Music played at weddings always reminds me of the music played for soldiers before they go into battle.
"One tradition I have with my friends is that when one of us gets married, we have a ton of fragrance oils and pretty bottles at the bachelorette party. Everyone puts a drop or two in a bottle for the bride and makes a wish, and the bride wears our creation on her wedding day."
"Getting married, for me, was the best thing I ever did. I was suddenly beset with an immense sense of release, that we have something more important than our separate selves, and that is the marriage. There's immense happiness that can come from working towards that."
A man's got two shots for jewelry: a wedding ring and a watch. The watch is a lot easier to get on and off than a wedding ring.
Falling in love was the easy part; planning a wedding - yikes!
"I love Spanish cities, particularly Barcelona, Madrid and Palma, which has the most amazing cathedral that I once went to for a wedding."
We were pretty good mates until the Beatles started to split up and Yoko came into it. It was more like old army buddies splitting up on account of wedding bells.
The greater our knowledge increases the more our ignorance unfolds.
"For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone."
"To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one's own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him."
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Work like you don't need the money. Love like you've never been hurt. Dance like nobody's watching.
In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.
Wisdom is knowing when you can't be wise.
"There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still."
Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."
"Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity."
"Wisdom, compassion, and courage are the three universally recognized moral qualities of men."
"It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see."
"A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them."
"We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future."
"Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens."
It's the little details that are vital. Little things make big things happen.
Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.
"Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one."
"Whatever you do in life, surround yourself with smart people who'll argue with you."
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
People don't notice whether it's winter or summer when they're happy.
"A tree is known by its fruit; a man by his deeds. A good deed is never lost; he who sows courtesy reaps friendship, and he who plants kindness gathers love."
A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.
Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness.
"There are only three things women need in life: food, water, and compliments."
"After women, flowers are the most lovely thing God has given the world."
A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous.
"Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women's empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all."
Reputation is what men and women think of us; character is what God and angels know of us.
A woman is like a tea bag - you can't tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water.
"Women are made to be loved, not understood."
No struggle can ever succeed without women participating side by side with men.
"There's three things men always talk about - women, sports, and cars."
"Sometimes negative news does come out, but it is often exaggerated and manipulated to spread scandal. Journalists sometimes risk becoming ill from coprophilia and thus fomenting coprophagia: which is a sin that taints all men and women, that is, the tendency to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects."
"Any time women come together with a collective intention, it's a powerful thing. Whether it's sitting down making a quilt, in a kitchen preparing a meal, in a club reading the same book, or around the table playing cards, or planning a birthday party, when women come together with a collective intention, magic happens."
"Finally, let us understand that when we stand together, we will always win. When men and women stand together for justice, we win. When black, white and Hispanic people stand together for justice, we win."
"All successful people men and women are big dreamers. They imagine what their future could be, ideal in every respect, and then they work every day toward their distant vision, that goal or purpose."
Anyone who says he can see through women is missing a lot.
"If women ran the world we wouldn't have wars, just intense negotiations every 28 days."
"Here's the thing, men have to also mature in how they see women, too. Because they need to understand that it's not just about how we look, it's about who we are. And I am going to tell you like this, 'If you can't love me with short hair, and you telling me I got to have long hair to be loved, guess what, I ain't the one for you.'"
Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives.
"It was we, the people; not we, the white male citizens; nor yet we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed the Union. And we formed it, not to give the blessings of liberty, but to secure them; not to the half of ourselves and the half of our posterity, but to the whole people - women as well as men."
I am an example of what is possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by people around them. I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life who taught me about quiet strength and dignity.
"I want to tell women that you need to love yourself and make yourself a priority. It's only when you are happy yourself, can you make everyone else around you happy. I am still a dreamer and still believe in fairy tales, but there is only that much one should give another person. You need to keep something for yourself."
"If it is right for men to fight for their freedom, and God knows what the human race would be like today if men had not, since time began, fought for their freedom, then it is right for women to fight for their freedom and the freedom of the children they bear."
"Fashion is here to help make people look very important. If they have good taste and choose what suits them, I give them options on how they can do that. It's always sexy, and it's always with the same result: making women look fantastic."
"Women and cats will do as they please, and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea."
"It's difficult for me to trust a woman. Men are attracted to beautiful women. Women are attracted to men who offer security - financial security. And if you have money and you're famous, women find that sexy."
"Women ought to have representatives, instead of being arbitrarily governed without any direct share allowed them in the deliberations of government."
"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do."
"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."
"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored."
"Work hard for what you want because it won't come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive."
"Success is the result of perfection, hard work, learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence."
"A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work."
"Stay positive and happy. Work hard and don't give up hope. Be open to criticism and keep learning. Surround yourself with happy, warm and genuine people."
"Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe."
"Work hard, stay positive, and get up early. It's the best part of the day."
"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."
"A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles."
It's all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family.
"There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."
Work like you don't need the money. Love like you've never been hurt. Dance like nobody's watching.
Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.
"Youth is the gift of nature, but age is a work of art."
"The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand."
"Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It's about impact, influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire team-mates and customers."
"A birthday is just another day where you go to work and people give you love. Age is just a state of mind, and you are as old as you think you are. You have to count your blessings and be happy."
"Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even when nobody else believes they can come true but you. These are not cliches but real tools you need no matter what you do in life to stay focused on your path."
"To be a champion, I think you have to see the big picture. It's not about winning and losing; it's about every day hard work and about thriving on a challenge. It's about embracing the pain that you'll experience at the end of a race and not being afraid. I think people think too hard and get afraid of a certain challenge."
"Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity."
"The greatest thing about where my life is right now is it's very relaxed and chill. I'm just hanging out, being myself and doing my work."
"The road to success is not easy to navigate, but with hard work, drive and passion, it's possible to achieve the American dream."
"Never stop fighting until you arrive at your destined place - that is, the unique you. Have an aim in life, continuously acquire knowledge, work hard, and have perseverance to realise the great life."
"Follow your passion, be prepared to work hard and sacrifice, and, above all, don't let anyone limit your dreams."
